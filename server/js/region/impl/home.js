   * These are implementation files for the Region manager.

   * a region that way we can send it to a player.
   * In order to create instanced regions, we will be using
   * the player's ID as an imaginary Z index. That way we
   * can reuse the exact location as many times as we need.
   * i.e. Player-1 (ID: 1529) -> 10-12-1529
   * Player-2 (ID: 3201) -> 10-12-3201
   * We then must ensure that those regions do not overlap,
   * region packets cannot be sent in-between them,
   * and no rendering is done whatsoever.
   * Because we are not messing too much with NPC location and whatnot,
   * we can trick the user into thinking they're alone.
